        <div class="Paragraph">Motherboards serve as the backbone of a computer, providing the essential infrastructure that allows all components to communicate and function together. Their primary function is to house the CPU, memory, storage devices, and expansion cards, while also providing the necessary power connections and data pathways. The purpose of a motherboard extends to supporting various hardware configurations, ensuring compatibility between components, and offering features like integrated audio, networking, and USB connectivity. Prices of motherboards vary widely based on their capabilities, brand, and feature set. Entry-level models, suitable for basic computing needs, might start around $50 to $100, offering essential features without extensive customization options. In contrast, high-end motherboards like the Gigabyte Z790 Aorus Xtreme, designed for enthusiasts and professionals, can exceed $500. These premium boards offer advanced features such as robust power delivery systems, extensive connectivity options, high-speed data transfer, superior build quality, and enhanced cooling solutions. They are tailored for users who demand the best performance, overclocking potential, and future-proofing for their high-performance computing setups.
