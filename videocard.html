        <div class="videocardParagraph">Video cards, also known as graphics cards or GPUs
            (Graphics Processing Units), are essential components in computers designed to
            handle and accelerate the rendering of images, videos, and animations. Their primary
            function is to take the load off the central processing unit (CPU) by performing complex
            graphical computations, which enhances the overall performance of the system, especially in tasks
            such as gaming, video editing, and 3D rendering. The purpose of video cards extends to supporting higher
            resolution displays, enabling multi-monitor setups, and providing better visual experiences in both professional
            and entertainment applications. Prices of video cards vary widely based on their capabilities, brand, and
            market demand. Entry-level models might start around $100, suitable for basic tasks and casual gaming,
            while high-end models designed for demanding applications and competitive gaming can exceed $1,500,
            reflecting their advanced features and superior performance. High-end video cards like the Nvidia GeForce
            RTX 4090 represent the pinnacle of GPU technology, offering unparalleled performance with cutting-edge
            features such as real-time ray tracing, AI-driven enhancements, and massive amounts of VRAM.
            These cards are tailored for enthusiasts and professionals who require the best possible graphical
            performance and are willing to invest upwards of $1,600 or more for the ultimate experience.
